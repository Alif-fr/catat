Introducing Catat!

your own personal productivity website!

This is my first big project that i'm working on, i've been wanting to create this website after learning about frontend stuff, and here it is. I'll be updating this file for each commit i'm doing!

In this project i'm using:

FrontEnd: NextJS

BackEnd: Node.JS

Database: PostgreSQL

this is my first time using NextJS and PostgreSQL, so expect some mistakes here and there. I'll try to minimize miswritten code!

---

First Commit:

Set up all the necessary tools that i'll be using with 0 changes (excep BackEnd server.ts for testing ),

Set up a terminal command that start both frontend and backend server simultaneously using "conccurently" from root folder.
